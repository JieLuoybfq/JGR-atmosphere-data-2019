# Optical modeling of black carbon with different coating material: The effect of coating configurations

### This is the introduction for data of the paper submitted to JGR-Atmosphere by Luo et al.

###  When using the data, please note:

- The files with _depo represents the data of linear backscattering depolarization ratio (LDR), the columns represent the LDR, N_s and black carbon volume fraction (%), respectively. Please note that in the second row, 580 actually should be 58, and here 580 is for the convenience of disposing the data.
-  The file without _depo represents the data of integral optical properties. The extinction, absorption and scattering efficiencies are presented in the the first three columns. N_s and black carbon volume fraction (%) are presented in 8,9 columns. For the other data, please see the guide of DDSCAT and MSTM.
-  The files with "edge" represents the data of black carbon models with coated way 1, and files without k represents k=8. The files with "Rg" represents the data of black carbon models with coated way 2, and "025Rg", "05Rg","Rg","2Rg", and "50Rg" represents Rc= "0.25Rg", "0.5Rg","Rg","2Rg", and "50Rg", respectively. 
-  Any question please contact Dr.Luo (ajybfq@mail.ustc.edu.cn) or Professor Zhang (qixing@ustc.edu.cn).
